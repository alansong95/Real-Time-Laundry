## How it works
![process](images/rtl_process.png)

Real Time Laundry consists of a camera and a server.

The camera is installed in a public laundry room, taking pictures of laundry machines every few minutes and sending them to the server via UDP.

The server receives the images and determines how many laundry machines are available with image processing (Laplacian of Gaussian filter) in real time.

The server then posts the information on Real Time Laundry website.
